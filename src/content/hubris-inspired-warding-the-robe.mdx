# Why wardrobe?

Off the back of having moved to a new place (finally purchasing a house, yay!), there comes the need to furnish it. Sure, one could buy stuff from IKEA or Amazon, but that would mean that we wouldn't be able to dive into a new project all full of dreams and overconfidence. I've laid a floor (badly), done a couple (two) workshops, how hard could it be? (famous last words)

The issue begins with the fact that I have a combined bedroom and office space, in a room that's 3m x 4m. As such, the space for fancy storage solutions are limited. After sleuthing through IKEA's various storage solutions, they either didn't fit the [vibe](/room_milestone.jpeg) or the size available. Plus, wardrobes are essentially just boxes with big doors on the front.

# Planning

So, reasoning is there, but how am I going to make it happen? To Google!

## Designing

Because I struggle to visualise the scale and quantity of stuff (ex. me having to buy extra flooring since my math wasn't mathing... twice), I decided to be a clever cookie and try to use software. A bit of a sleuth later, found [Autodesk Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal). Now, it's a neat piece of software, and the personal use is free, but it's still limited, and quite complex. 
Lo and behold, an Open Source alternative emerges üíú [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) is a bit clunky, occasionally buggy, and has a noticeable learning curve as OS software often has. So, what do I decide to do? Make it even harder for myself by also adding on the Woodworking add-on! Why learn only one thing, when you could be learning two things at once! Yay hubris!

## Parts

So I went to find some reasonably priced sliding door hardware. As is sadly too often the case, this kinda query ended up leading me to Amazon. It seems like everyone and their mums are selling barn door hardware, but not the hidey slidey variety. After scrolling & massaging the query later (why can't Amazon have an exclusion filter like Google Search does, please Amazon ü•∫), I found some options. 
Hurray! Until I did the math. By tiny gods, 6 whole centimeters taken up just by the doors! Considering I'm already going for small and tight (üòè) that won't do. Alas, my hubris is calling again. Time to figure out another solution. While wheels might've been among the bestest of inventions humankind has come up with, they ain't gonna serve me well in this case. So, time to look at another top-10 invetion - ball bearnings. Specifically, using ball bearings as wheels, and having the doors run in a channel. Another excuse for me to get that router üòè

## Looks

Should I paint? Wax? Laquer? I don't know, so many options!

# Assembling

This is getting way too long, and personally I'm not a fan of those recipe blogs where they tell a whole life story before getting to the big that's useful/interesting/relevant. So, the assembly itself is a separate blog post, [go there instead](/warding-the-robe).
